Paper_title: Paper title as provided in the selected published paper
Paper_author: Paper reference with author name and year of publication
Data_extraction_method: Describes the source from which data was extracted
Sel_coeff: Relative fitness calculated as described in the methods section "Relative fitness calculation"
Error_new: Standard error associated with relative fitness calculated as described in the methods section "Relative fitness calculation"
Sel_temp: Selection temperature used in the respective selection experiments
Assay_temp:Assay temperature used in the respective temperature assay for the selection experiments
Rel_assay_temp: (Assay temperature) - (Selection temperature) 
Abs_rel_assay_temp: Absolute value of the Rel_assay_temp
Sign:Describes whether temperature selection was carried out at temperatures "high" , "equal", "low" temperature than the ancestor/control population in a selection experiment
Side:Describes whether the Temperature reaction norm lies on the positive or negative side of the zero point (Assay temperatue = Secetion temperature point). It shows whether the assay temperature was higher or lower than the selection temperature.
No_of_Gen: The number of generations the temperature selection experiment was carried out 
Recombination: Describes if the populations reproduced sexually (recombination "yes") or asexually (recombination "no")
Type_Gen_var: presence or absence of standing genetic variation or denovo genetic variation
Ans_vs_Control: Describes whether the "Selecion coefficient" was calculated using fitness values at a given temperature from ancestor or a control population (populations maintained at control temperature)

Curve_ID: Unique identification of each temperature performance curve included in the analysis
Genus: Genus of the species associated with each Curve_ID 
Species: Species of the species associated with each Curve_ID 
Scientific_name: Scientific name of the species associated with each Curve_ID 
Exp_design: Factorial combination of "Sign" and "Side". SL_TH: Sign "low" + Side "positive", SH_TL: Sign "high" + Side "negative",EQ_TH: Sign "equal" + Side "positive"
