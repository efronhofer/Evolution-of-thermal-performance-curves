MaxSel_coeff: Relative fitness calculated as described in the methods section "Relative fitness calculation"
MaxError_new:Standard error associated with relative fitness calculated as described in the methods section "Relative fitness calculation"
Sign_max: Describes whether temperature selection was carried out at temperatures "high" , "equal", "low" temperature than the ancestor/control population in a selection experiment
No_of_Gen_Max: The number of generations the temperature selection experiment was carried out 
Recombination_Max: Describes if the populations reproduced sexually (recombination "yes") or asexually (recombination "no")
